  <h1>Cheesy Mushroom Bowl of Sin</h1>  

  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>A delectable mushroom-based treat introduced to us by our beloved husband. A delightful symphony
    of flavors which uses cremini mushrooms as a base.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>2 pounds cremini mushrooms dried with a paper towel and thickly sliced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic finely chopped</li>
    <li>¼ cup chicken broth or stick or vegetable broth</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
    <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
    <li>kosher pepper to taste</li>
    <li>½ cup mozzarella shredded or grated</li>
    <li>¼ cup Parmesan cheese shredded or grated</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon thyme freshly chopped</li>
   </ul>

  <h2>Steps:</h2>
   <ol></ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottom skillet over medium heat.</li>

    <li>In a small bowl, whisk the stock and cornstarch.</li>
        
    <li>Add the mushrooms in a single layer and cook undisturbed for about 2-3 minutes, then stir and continue to cook for 1-2 minutes more. 
        You might have to cook them in batches, to avoid overcrowding the pan.</li>
        
    <li>Once all mushrooms are slightly tender and golden, add the garlic and cook until fragrant, for 1 minute.</li>
        
    <li>Add the stock-starch mixture together with the almond milk and season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Stir until sauce begins to thicken, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        
    <li>Add in the shredded cheeses. Continue to cook until the cheese is fully melted, then stir in the herbs and take off the heat.</li>
